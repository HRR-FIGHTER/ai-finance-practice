# Practice Project – Stock Price Prediction with LSTM + FinBERT Sentiment

**Author:** Hamid Reza Ranjbar

**Note:** This is a **practice/test** project for learning and demonstration purposes only — not investment advice.

## Project overview
This repo explores whether combining daily financial-news sentiment (via FinBERT) with historical closing prices (CP) improves short-term stock price prediction using an LSTM model.

## Contents
- `practice_lstm_sentiment.ipynb` — main notebook: data pipeline, sentiment extraction, LSTM model, plots.
- `sample_data.csv` — small sample dataset (for quick reproducibility).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore` — files to ignore (data, keys, etc.)

## Data
I used a dataset obtained from Kaggle. Download the full dataset from Kaggle (link):
